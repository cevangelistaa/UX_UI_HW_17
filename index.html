                <p>For me, design is a medium to tell stories. I find my spark of joy both in crafting and listening to stories, and enjoy seeing ideas transform into tangible products that impact users’ lives.</p>
                <p>I’m driven by a passion for turning complex problems into creative solutions. My approach to design involves gaining insights from users’ past experiences to help shape solutions, all while drawing inspiration from various ideas and products available in the market. This ensures that any and all designs resonate with the users who interact with them. </p>
